# Backtracking Algorithms in C++


Welcome to the Backtracking Algorithms repository! This repository contains C++ implementations of classic backtracking problems, including Tower of Hanoi, 4-Color Problem, Latin Square, and N-Queen Problem. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand backtracking or an experienced developer seeking optimized solutions, you'll find valuable resources and code examples here.


## Contents

1. Tower of Hanoi: Solve the classic Tower of Hanoi problem using recursive backtracking.

2. 4-Color Problem: Implement the 4-Color Problem solution using backtracking to color a map with four colors such that no two adjacent regions have the same color.
3. Latin Square: Generate Latin Squares using backtracking, where each row and column contains unique elements from 1 to N.
4. N-Queen Problem: Find all possible solutions to the N-Queen Problem, where N queens must be placed on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.







## Getting Started
To get started with using this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BRIJESH6063/AI-Exercises
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AI-Exercises
    ```
4. Compile the C++ files using your preferred compiler:
    ```bash
    g++ -o tower_of_hanoi tower_of_hanoi.cpp
    g++ -o four_color_problem four_color_problem.cpp
    g++ -o latin_square latin_square.cpp
    g++ -o n_queen n_queen.cpp

    ```
4. Execute the compiled programs and explore the solutions to the backtracking problems.
